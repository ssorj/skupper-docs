# Using the Skupper API

You can use YAML API resources on Kubernetes after installing the
Skupper controller to

* [Configure sites](site-configuration.html) - Create and update sites
  in different locations
* [Link sites](site-linking.html) - Link sites to form a network
* [Expose services](service-exposure.html) - Expose application
  services on the network

## Unfiled

A typical workflow is to create a site, link sites together, and
expose services to the application network.
