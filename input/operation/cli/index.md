# Using the Skupper CLI

You can use the `skupper` command-line interface (CLI) on Kubernetes
after installing the Skupper controller to configure sites, links, and
services.

The Skupper CLI is designed to generate and consume standard API
resources, ensuring that sites, links, and services configured using
the CLI are identical to those configured directly through the API.
