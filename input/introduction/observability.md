# Skupper observability

The Skupper Network Observer is a component that attaches to the
Skupper router network in order to expose Skupper network
telemetry. When installed alongside a Skupper site, it collects
operational data from all sites in the network and exposes them via
the API and metrics that back the Skupper network console.
